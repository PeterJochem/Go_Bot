# Description
I am building a deep-learning Go agent with a robotic arm to also manipulate the pieces. I am using Keras to train the neural network, MoveIt to do motion planning, and ROS to tie everything together.

# ROS Packages
##go_core 
go_core is a Go engine. It has a deep-learning AI to play against. The agent learns to play go by playing many games against itself. Its learned policy is stored as a nueral network in Keras.

##go_reactor
This package runs nodes to facilitate the ReactorX200 robot arm manipulating Go pieces.
